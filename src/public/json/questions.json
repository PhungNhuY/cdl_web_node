            "answer3": "3 seconds",
            "answer4": "7 seconds",
            "answerCorrect": "1",
            "explanation": "The formula for following distance is one second per ten feet of vehicle, plus an extra second if you are traveling over 40 mph. Therefore, for a 30-foot vehicle traveling at 55 mph, you should leave a following distance of 4 seconds."

            "answerCorrect": "2",
            "explanation": "You should always back toward the driver's side because you will be able to see things much more easily. For example, you can keep an eye on the vehicle's rear by viewing it from your side window. If your truck pulls in either direction, it needs service. Your neck's comfort should not affect your safety decision."

            "answerCorrect": "2",
            "explanation": "If you are convicted of DUI for a second time, you will lose your CDL privileges for life. While you are driving a CMV, a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) of 0.04% or above qualifies as DUI. Your first offense is a wake-up call and a chance to get help, but your second offense is going to mean unemployment. If you get a DUI, seek help before you lose your salary and your future."

            "answer4": "6 to 8 hours",
            "answerCorrect": "1",
            "explanation": "Sleep debt is a dangerous condition in which missing sleep adds up until you risk falling asleep at the wheel unless you get some rest. People are often surprised that getting less than 6 hours of sleep per night triples the risk of an accident. At least 15 percent of heavy truck crashes are believed to involve driver fatigue. According to the Alabama Commercial Driver License Manual, the average person needs seven or eight hours of sleep every 24 hours."

People are often surprised that getting less than 6 hours of sleep per night triples the risk of an accident. At least 15% of heavy truck crashes are believed to involve driver fatigue. Before a trip, you should get adequate sleep (adults need 8 to 9 hours to maintain alertness); prepare your route carefully to identify total distance, stopping points, and other logistical considerations; schedule trips for the hours during which you are normally awake, not the middle of the night; drive with a passenger; avoid medications that cause drowsiness; consult your physician if you suffer from daytime sleepiness, have difficulty sleeping at night, or take frequent naps; and incorporate exercise into your daily life to give yourself more energy."

This corrective maneuver is called a pull-up. Note, however, that you should be able to back your vehicle successfully without too many such corrections. During your CDL skills test, your examiner may penalize you for too many pull-ups."

Before a trip, you should get adequate sleep (adults need 8 to 9 hours to maintain alertness); prepare your route carefully to identify total distance, stopping points, and other logistical considerations; schedule trips for the hours during which you are normally awake, not the middle of the night; drive with a passenger; avoid medications that cause drowsiness; consult your physician if you suffer from daytime sleepiness, have difficulty sleeping at night, or take frequent naps; and incorporate exercise into your daily life to give yourself more energy."

Low tire pressures cause faster tire wear and reduced cornering ability and increase the effect of hydroplaning. Underinflation also causes increased flexing of the tire, which increases tire temperature. Tires that overheat can catch fire. Of course, even properly inflated tires are no guarantee against skids."

At higher speeds, the tires cannot channel the water away very well, and your tires may start to lose contact with the road and ride over the water like a set of water skis.

Instead, if your vehicle has a manual transmission, you should downshift; if your vehicle has an automatic transmission, you should select a low range that prevents the transmission from shifting up beyond the selected gear. This will generate a braking effect to slow the vehicle, known as engine braking. The lower the gear, the greater the engine braking effect. Apply the brakes only when engine braking is insufficient or you want to stop."

            "explanation": "Downshifting before starting down a hill allows you to take advantage of engine braking. You should downshift to the gear required, which is usually lower than the gear required to climb the hill. Downshifting before a curve improves stability and helps you get the power you will need to accelerate out of the turn."

You should downshift to the gear required, which is usually lower than the gear required to climb the hill. Downshifting before a curve improves stability and helps you get the power you will need to accelerate out of the turn."

Before a trip, you should get adequate sleep (adults need 8 to 9 hours to maintain alertness); prepare your route carefully to identify total distance, stopping points, and other logistical considerations; schedule trips for the hours during which you are normally awake, not the middle of the night; drive with a passenger; avoid medications that cause drowsiness; consult your physician if you suffer from daytime sleepiness, have difficulty sleeping at night, or take frequent naps; and incorporate exercise into your daily life to give yourself more energy."

            "answerCorrect": "1",
            "explanation": "Downshifting before starting down a hill lets you take advantage of engine braking. You should downshift to the gear required, which is usually lower than the gear required to climb the hill. Downshifting before a curve improves stability and helps you get the power you will need to accelerate out of the turn."

Before a trip, you should get adequate sleep (adults need 8 to 9 hours to maintain alertness); prepare your route carefully to identify total distance, stopping points, and other logistical considerations; schedule trips for the hours during which you are normally awake, not the middle of the night; drive with a passenger; avoid medications that cause drowsiness; consult your physician if you suffer from daytime sleepiness, have difficulty sleeping at night, or take frequent naps; and incorporate exercise into your daily life to give yourself more energy."

            "explanation": "Downshifting before starting down a hill lets you take advantage of engine braking. You should downshift to the gear required, which is usually lower than the gear required to climb the hill. Downshifting before a curve improves stability and helps you get the power you will need to accelerate out of the turn."

            "explanation": "Sleep debt is a dangerous condition in which missing sleep adds up until you risk falling asleep at the wheel unless you get some rest. People are often surprised that getting less than 6 hours of sleep per night triples the risk of an accident. At least 15% of heavy truck crashes are believed to involve driver fatigue. Before a trip, you should get adequate sleep (adults need 8 to 9 hours to maintain alertness); prepare your route carefully to identify total distance, stopping points, and other logistical considerations; schedule trips for the hours during which you are normally awake, not the middle of the night; drive with a passenger; avoid medications that cause drowsiness; consult your physician if you suffer from daytime sleepiness, have difficulty sleeping at night, or take frequent naps; and incorporate exercise into your daily life to give yourself more energy."

People are often surprised that getting less than 6 hours of sleep per night triples the risk of an accident. At least 15% of heavy truck crashes are believed to involve driver fatigue. Before a trip, you should get adequate sleep (adults need 8 to 9 hours to maintain alertness); prepare your route carefully to identify total distance, stopping points, and other logistical considerations; schedule trips for the hours during which you are normally awake, not the middle of the night; drive with a passenger; avoid medications that cause drowsiness; consult your physician if you suffer from daytime sleepiness, have difficulty sleeping at night, or take frequent naps; and incorporate exercise into your daily life to give yourself more energy."

            "answerCorrect": "4",
            "explanation": "Sleep debt is a dangerous condition in which missing sleep adds up until you risk falling asleep at the wheel unless you get some rest. People are often surprised that getting less than 6 hours of sleep per night triples the risk of an accident. At least 15% of heavy truck crashes are believed to involve driver fatigue. Before a trip, you should get adequate sleep (adults need 8 to 9 hours to maintain alertness); prepare your route carefully to identify total distance, stopping points, and other logistical considerations; schedule trips for the hours during which you are normally awake, not the middle of the night; drive with a passenger; avoid medications that cause drowsiness; consult your physician if you suffer from daytime sleepiness, have difficulty sleeping at night, or take frequent naps; and incorporate exercise into your daily life to give yourself more energy."

            "explanation": "If you have a manual transmission vehicle, partly engage the clutch before you take your right foot off the brake. Set the parking brake whenever necessary to keep from rolling back. Release the parking brake only when you have applied enough engine power to keep from rolling back. On a tractor-trailer equipped with a trailer brake hand valve, the hand valve can be applied to keep from rolling back."

People are often surprised that getting less than 6 hours of sleep per night triples the risk of an accident. At least 15% of heavy truck crashes are believed to involve driver fatigue. Before a trip, you should get adequate sleep (adults need 8 to 9 hours to maintain alertness); prepare your route carefully to identify total distance, stopping points, and other logistical considerations; schedule trips for the hours during which you are normally awake, not the middle of the night; drive with a passenger; avoid medications that cause drowsiness; consult your physician if you suffer from daytime sleepiness, have difficulty sleeping at night, or take frequent naps; and incorporate exercise into your daily life to give yourself more energy."

            "explanation": "Sleep debt is a dangerous condition in which missing sleep adds up until you risk falling asleep at the wheel unless you get some rest. People are often surprised that getting less than 6 hours of sleep per night triples the risk of an accident. At least 15% of heavy truck crashes are believed to involve driver fatigue. Before a trip, you should get adequate sleep (adults need 8 to 9 hours to maintain alertness); prepare your route carefully to identify total distance, stopping points, and other logistical considerations; schedule trips for the hours during which you are normally awake, not the middle of the night; drive with a passenger; avoid medications that cause drowsiness; consult your physician if you suffer from daytime sleepiness, have difficulty sleeping at night, or take frequent naps; and incorporate exercise into your daily life to give yourself more energy."

            "explanation": "Sleep debt is a dangerous condition in which missing sleep adds up until you risk falling asleep at the wheel unless you get some rest. People are often surprised that getting less than 6 hours of sleep per night triples the risk of an accident. At least 15% of heavy truck crashes are believed to involve driver fatigue. Before a trip, you should get adequate sleep (adults need 8 to 9 hours to maintain alertness); prepare your route carefully to identify total distance, stopping points, and other logistical considerations; schedule trips for the hours during which you are normally awake, not the middle of the night; drive with a passenger; avoid medications that cause drowsiness; consult your physician if you suffer from daytime sleepiness, have difficulty sleeping at night, or take frequent naps; and incorporate exercise into your daily life to give yourself more energy."

If your truck pulls in either direction, it needs service. There may be hazards on either side of your vehicle, of course."

            "explanation": "If you keep applying the brakes to control your speed on a steep descent, the brakes will fade (lose their effectiveness). Instead, if your vehicle has an automatic transmission, select a low range that prevents the transmission from shifting up beyond the selected gear. This will generate a braking effect to slow the vehicle, known as engine braking. The lower the gear, the greater the engine braking effect. Apply the brakes only when engine braking is insufficient or you want to stop."

Another tip: If there are two left-turn lanes available, use the one on the right. You may not have enough room to turn left from the leftmost turn lane without swinging right. If you swing right, another driver may try to pass you on your left as you are turning."

            "explanation": "Sleep debt is a dangerous condition in which missing sleep adds up until you risk falling asleep at the wheel unless you get some rest. People are often surprised that getting less than 6 hours of sleep per night triples the risk of an accident. At least 15% of heavy truck crashes are believed to involve driver fatigue. Before a trip, you should get adequate sleep (adults need 8 to 9 hours to maintain alertness); prepare your route carefully to identify total distance, stopping points, and other logistical considerations; schedule trips for the hours during which you are normally awake, not the middle of the night; drive with a passenger; avoid medications that cause drowsiness; consult your physician if you suffer from daytime sleepiness, have difficulty sleeping at night, or take frequent naps; and incorporate exercise into your daily life to give yourself more energy."

Before a trip, you should get adequate sleep (adults need 8 to 9 hours to maintain alertness); prepare your route carefully to identify total distance, stopping points, and other logistical considerations; schedule trips for the hours during which you are normally awake, not the middle of the night; drive with a passenger; avoid medications that cause drowsiness; consult your physician if you suffer from daytime sleepiness, have difficulty sleeping at night, or take frequent naps; and incorporate exercise into your daily life to give yourself more energy."
