                            A CDL is a Commercial Driver's License that is required to drive commercial motor vehicles.
                            This
                            license is needed for any drivers that will be operating commercial driving equipment or
                            other
                            types of heavy machinery. To get a CDL, you will need to pass the CDL training courses and a
                            driving test quite like getting a regular driver's license. The first year it was required
                            to
                            carry a CDL was the year 1986 when the Vehicle Motor and Safety Act was passed. Before this,
                            each state had its own laws for driving heavy machinery, causing there to be unnecessary
                            accidents and several road deaths. The new law prohibits commercial driving without the
                            proper
                            CDL license. Even hot shot truckers are required to have a CDL on the road.
