                        <p class="excert">For the various types of commercial driver's license, the basic
                            requirements are federally mandated, but states are allowed to impose additional
                            requirements of
                            their own.</p>
                        <p class="excert">For example, it is a federal law that you must be 21 years of age or older to
                            drive commercially interstate. However,
                            many states will issue a CDL strictly for intrastate driving for those who are 18 or older;
                            check your state's
                            regulations. When you are ready to apply for your CDL, and you've filled out your state's
                            CDL
                            application, you'll
                            need to provide proof of the following:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>your social security number,</li>
                            <li>your identity, and</li>
                            <li>your residency.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p class="excert">Documents accepted as proof of your social security number by most states
                            usually
                            include your social security card,
                            a Medicare ID card, a current ID card from any of the US Armed Forces (active, retired,
                            reserve,
                            or dependent), or a
                            military separation document, otherwise known as a DD-214. Some states may accept some other
                            forms of social
                            security number proof, so check before you go.</p>
                        <p class="excert">The list of documents accepts as proof of your identity varies even more by
                            state. Some of the most commonly accepted
                            include a US birth certificate or certified copy of a said certificate, valid US passport,
                            USCIS
                            American Indian
                            Card, valid military ID card, certificate of either Citizenship or Naturalization, Permanent
                            Resident Card, or
                            Temporary Resident ID Card. In all likelihood, your state probably accepts several other
                            documents as proof of
                            identity, so it's best to check your state CDL manual or DMV website for the latest
                            information.
                        </p>
                        <p class="excert">Proof of residency requirements will vary by state as well. You may only need
                            to
                            provide a copy of a single utility
                            bill for some states, such as Alabama, while others like California may require two or three
                            different documents
                            from a list of up to eighteen different options, and the address on the documents must match
                            the
                            address on your CDL
                            application. Again, it's best to check your state's DMV website before you go to avoid any
                            problems.</p>
                        <p class="excert">In addition to providing proof of your given name, birth date, state of
                            residency, age, and social security number,
                            providing proof that you're medically able to drive commercially is part of how to get your
                            CDL
                            license. The easiest
                            portion of this process consists of a vision exam, which you will take with the rest of your
                            CDL
                            exams, but the more
                            in-depth portion involves submitting required medical reports. Due to a new law, after 2022,
                            whether you drive
                            intrastate or interstate, you must supply two forms to your state commercial driver's
                            licensing
                            agency: the Medical
                            Examination Report Form (MCSA-5875) and the Medical Examiner's Certificate Form (MCSA-5876).
                            If
                            you are going to
                            drive interstate, you must use a medical examiner listed on the National Registry of
                            Certified
                            Medical Examiners to fill out your forms. If these
                            forms are required part of your job, then your employer must pay for them.</p>
